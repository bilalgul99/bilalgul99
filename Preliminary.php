        <dd> The limited also known as the initial testing in the selection lingua happens in the selections handles also known as AES and RC for short these are the same centers that you have chosen during the registration process so you get to choose that
            center your own convenience make sure to choose the one that is nearest to you because the testing procedure is same all over the collection of centers the normal testing procedure spans over three days most of the time which come in consecutive
            order with only the official Holidays in between. The location and the contact numbers of each and everyone of the ace and RCâ€™s are shared on the websites of the selection forces and you can find the location on Google search quite easily
            so make sure that you first know the way to the center and get it confirmed a day or two before you have to go there. Because many people reach late on the testing which causes a lot of inconvenience because you cannot rudes late and they
            will not allow you to give the test late General structure
        </dd>

        <dd> The third day comprising of the interview is only valid for some courses and especially for the medical credit course the interview is not taken in the initial selection process and you automatically go to the I GHQ selection board form after
            completing the second dayactivity. </dd>
        <dd> When you reach the selection Centre successfully before 30 minutes the time return on your roll number slip you will be received at the reception there show your original documents and get them stamped on the back also remember to carry at least
            for photographs some cash and all of your original documents along with their photocopy including the CNIC of feel your guardian or father. If you have plastic coatings on your original documents specially the mark sheets then do get them

        <dd> The intelligence tests further consists of two types of tests namely the verbal and then the non-verbal. </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt> Chain of Success </dt>
        <br>
        <dd> These three tests form a chain in succession to the preceding one. That means in order to reach the next one you have to clear the past one. Here, we want to make clear that no commulative results are made for a criterion of pass or fail. You
            have to first clear the verbal test to reach the non-verbal portion then after that you start the academic portion if you avoid the red line coming up as a result of the previous test. </dd>
        <dd> At the successful completion of the computer test you have to show the last green screen to the staff present there and then they out a stamp on your roll no slip also they assign you the date for physical examination which must probably the very
            next working day now go and fex your legs a bit because you are going to need them. To find out why click on the next step . </dd>
        <dd> On the second day of the testing in the preliminary aka initial testing you have to give physical and medical test. </dd>
